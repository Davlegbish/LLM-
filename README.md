# LLM Question And Answer Application

Project Overview:

This project leverages LangChain, a framework designed to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs), to create a Q&A system. The application takes user-provided documents in various formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX) as input, processes the content, and enables real-time Q&A by interacting with the data. Users can ask natural language questions related to the document, and the system will return precise, contextually relevant answers.
