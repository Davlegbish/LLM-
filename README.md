# LLM Question And Answer Application

Project Overview:

This project leverages LangChain, a framework designed to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs), to create a Q&A system. The application takes user-provided documents in various formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX) as input, processes the content, and enables real-time Q&A by interacting with the data. Users can ask natural language questions related to the document, and the system will return precise, contextually relevant answers.

Steps Involved:
1. Environment Setup:
> Install necessary libraries such as LangChain, PyPDF2, python-docx, pytesseract, openai, and others.
> Set up a virtual environment for the project to manage dependencies.
> Obtain API keys for LLMs (e.g., OpenAI API or others) and configure environment variables for secure access.

2. Document Upload and Parsing:
> Implement a user interface (UI) or API to allow document uploads.
> Use appropriate parsers for each document type:
PDF Files: Use libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber to extract text from PDF documents.
TXT Files: Read plain text directly using Python's built-in file handling.
DOCX Files: Utilize python-docx to extract text from Microsoft Word documents.
> Normalize extracted content to remove unwanted characters, whitespace, and metadata.

3. Chunking and Embedding:
> Split the document content into manageable chunks (e.g., paragraphs or sections) for efficient processing.
> Generate embeddings for each chunk using pre-trained models (e.g., OpenAI embeddings.).
> Store the embeddings in a vector database like Chromadb.

4. Query Processing and Similarity Search:
> Implement a query handling mechanism to receive user questions.
> Perform a similarity search in the vector database to find the most relevant chunks based on the query.
> Use LangChainâ€™s RetrievalQA chain to retrieve and refine the relevant information.

6. Answer Generation:
> Pass the retrieved chunks and user query to an LLM to generate context-aware responses.
> Utilize LangChain's prompt templates to structure prompts for better coherence and accuracy.
> Implement mechanisms to ensure concise and accurate answers, including multi-turn dialogues if needed.

7. User Interface (UI) Development:
> A user-friendly web-based interface using frameworks like Streamlit.
> Users can upload documents, input questions, and receive answers in real time.
> History of questions and answers for better user experience.
